# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

[Extract from feature spec: primary requirement + technical approach from research]

## Technical Context

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the content in this section with the technical details
  for the project. The structure here is presented in advisory capacity to guide
  the iteration process.
-->

**Language/Version**: [e.g., Python 3.11, Swift 5.9, Rust 1.75 or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Primary Dependencies**: [e.g., FastAPI, UIKit, LLVM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Storage**: [if applicable, e.g., PostgreSQL, CoreData, files or N/A]  
**Testing**: [e.g., pytest, XCTest, cargo test or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Target Platform**: [e.g., Linux server, iOS 15+, WASM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
**Project Type**: [single/web/mobile - determines source structure]  
**Performance Goals**: [domain-specific, e.g., 1000 req/s, 10k lines/sec, 60 fps or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Constraints**: [domain-specific, e.g., <200ms p95, <100MB memory, offline-capable or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Scale/Scope**: [domain-specific, e.g., 10k users, 1M LOC, 50 screens or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

Verify compliance with GameReviewApp Constitution v1.0.0:

- [ ] **Code Quality Standards**: Feature design supports clean code principles (functions <50 lines, cyclomatic complexity ≤10)
- [ ] **Code Quality Standards**: SOLID principles can be applied to proposed architecture
- [ ] **Code Quality Standards**: Documentation plan includes public API docs, inline comments for complex logic
- [ ] **Testing Standards**: TDD workflow planned (tests written first, approved, then implementation)
- [ ] **Testing Standards**: Test coverage targets defined (80% minimum, 95% for critical paths)
- [ ] **Testing Standards**: Test pyramid respected (70% unit, 20% integration, 10% E2E)
- [ ] **UX Consistency**: Design system components identified and documented
- [ ] **UX Consistency**: Accessibility requirements planned (WCAG 2.1 AA, keyboard navigation, screen readers)
- [ ] **UX Consistency**: Responsive design breakpoints defined (mobile 320px+, tablet 768px+, desktop 1024px+)
- [ ] **UX Consistency**: User feedback mechanisms planned (loading states, error messages, success confirmations)
- [ ] **Performance Requirements**: API response time targets documented (p50 <200ms, p95 <500ms, p99 <1s)
- [ ] **Performance Requirements**: Page load time targets defined (FCP <1.5s, TTI <3.5s on 3G)
- [ ] **Performance Requirements**: Resource constraints specified (memory <100MB mobile, <200MB web)
- [ ] **Performance Requirements**: Monitoring and alerting strategy defined

## Complexity Tracking

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
